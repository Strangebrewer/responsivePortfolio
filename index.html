                    Hi, I'm Keith. Professionally, I'm a writer. Soon, I'll be a developer, too. This website is a record of my progress in web development.

            <p>
                    For ten years, I worked as an auditor and tech writer in an environmental engineering office. I loved the purpose of the work (professional treehugger!), but the daily grind was getting old, and I was ready for something new. About a year ago, I wanted to build a website for my wedding so we could coordinate invitations, accommodations, etc. but I found the available wedding websites lacking. So, I decided to build my own. It was frustrating, confusing, and difficult but ultimately it was also rewarding, and it sparked a new passion in me.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                    I have lived in a few places, but Utah is my home. I am married, I have a daughter, and I love DIY projects. I have a degree in English and I love good writing. I'm also into snowboarding, hiking, and live music. And I love lazy Sundays, so Netflix is a dear, dear friend.
