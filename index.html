                    Hi! Welcome to my portfolio. This website is a record of my progress as a web developer.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                    For the last ten years, I have worked as a technical writer for an environmental engineering firm, and, while that has been interesting, I wanted to move into something new. About a year ago, I needed to build a website for my wedding so we could coordinate invitations, participation, and local accommodations, but I found the available wedding website templates too limiting. So, I decided to build my own from scratch instead. It was frustrating, confusing, and difficult, but ultimately rewarding, and it sparked a new passion in me.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                    I have lived in many places, but Utah is my home. I am married, I have a daughter, and I love writing, snowboarding, hiking, and live music. I also love lazy Sundays, so Netflix is a dear, dear friend. I have a degree in English Literature and I love to learn.
            </p>
